Waitlist for YDW 2013
---------------------


Thanks for your interest in attending YDW 2013! The event is full, but you can still join our waitlist by submitting your info below. If a slot opens up and you're the next in line, we'll email you with instructions on how to finalize your registration.


You are not required to pay any fees until you accept an offered slot. If/when you get in, you will have 7 days from when we notify you to pay your selected fee (see more information about our [payment system](\"http://www.youthdanceweekend.org/general-info/register-details/\" "\\"Pricing")). If the full balance is not received before the deadline, you will forfeit your slot to the next person on the waitlist.


EXCEPTION: if you are offered a slot on or after Sept. 16th you will only have 2 days to pay. This is so we can rapidly move the waitlist as we approach the event. No waitlist spots will be offered after Sept. 26th.


*Be forewarned the registration form is a bit clunky. Sorry 'bout that, we're working to improve it for next year.*
