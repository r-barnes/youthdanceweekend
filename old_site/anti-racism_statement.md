As the Youth Dance Weekend Committee, we acknowledge that racism and systemic bias exist. We acknowledge that many of the folk music and dance traditions we love have roots in Black traditions, and that the history of American folk music is complex and deeply entwined with racism against Black communities. We acknowledge that our Kinhaven venue sits on [Wabanaki (Dawnland Confederacy)](\"https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/wabanaki-confederacy/\") and [N’dakina (Abenaki / Abénaquis)](\"https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/abenaki-abenaquis/\") land.


We are committed to antiracist beliefs and practices, and we hold the expectation that our dance community will be committed to those beliefs and practices too. We strive to educate ourselves, learn from the past and honor that history in our approach to traditional music and dance. 


We want to provide an inclusive, safe and welcoming environment for everyone. White supremacy and white nationalism have no place at Youth Dance Weekend. Black lives matter. As a reminder, we have zero\-tolerance for harassment of any kind against any marginalized group. 


As a once\-per\-year event that brings together people from dance communities nationwide and even globally, we aim to celebrate our different backgrounds and perspectives. We encourage you to engage in discussions about these topics, to call out racism and call each other in for conversation, and learn from one other. We hope that all attendees will be inspired to bring this mindset back to their home dance communities.


We are still working to compile a list of educational resources, which you see below. If you have any you would like to contribute, please send them our way!
