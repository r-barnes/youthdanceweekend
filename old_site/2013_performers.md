The bodaciousness of this yearâ€™s staff is well beyond the bounds of sense or reason. They are:



 * [The Mean Lids](\"http://www.meanlids.com/\") (Miriam Larson, Ben Smith, and Matt Turino) from Illinois, making music as awesome as the hats they wear.

 * The Jig Lords (Brad Battey, Kendall Rogers, and Marnen Laibnow\-Koser) will preside over some fine music, indeed, not restricted merely to jigs.

 * [Sarah VanNorstrand](\"http://www.sarahcallsdances.com/Sarahcallsdances/Bio.html\") enchanting us with her mellifluous voice during contra dances.

 * Dan Blim, master of our English dancing destiny, will take us on a rollercoaster of amazingness.

 * Phase X ( Christopher Jacoby and Ross Harriss) will match the wavelength to the frequency and give us a rollicking techno contra Friday night. They will also make the other performers sound good by doing sound.
