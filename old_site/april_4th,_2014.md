We hope you’ve enjoyed a lovely (long!) winter. Here’s something we hope will warm you up like a spring breeze \- the Youth Dance Weekend spring news!

### Lottery/Registration


Registration opens June 1st, 2014\. If we reach capacity before June 20th we will hold a lottery to determine who will attend YDW. You can [read the details here](\"http://www.youthdanceweekend.org/ydw-2014/register/registration-details/\" "\\"Details\\"") on the way the lottery works. The lottery will give some preference to groups with first\-timers and folks who were not accepted in the lottery last year.


### New Committee Member: Harris Lapiroff


The wonderful Julia Nickles retired from the committee this year. She has been with YDW from the start and we are grateful for all the work she put in to make YDW great. Sad as it is to see Julia go, we also couldn’t be happier to welcome our newest member, Harris Lapiroff, aboard. Harris is an Oberlin alum, where he helped organize the Dandelion Romp as a student, and now lives in the D.C. area. We look forward to benefitting from his thoughtful, can\-do attitude. He’s already proven his stamina: he took an overnight bus from D.C. to make it to our last committee meeting! Welcome Harris!
