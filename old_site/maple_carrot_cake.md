### Prep


Sift together all dry ingredients. Crack eggs into a separate bowl. Shred the carrots using either a box grater or a food processor.


Rough chop the nuts until they are about the size of pea gravel. Spread the chopped nuts onto a sheet tray and toast them at a low temperature until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them!


### Assembly and Baking


Preheat oven to 375° F. Grease baking pans.


Using the paddle attachment on a stand mixer, combine all maple syrup, oil, and sugar until uniform. Add in the eggs, a few at a time, until all incorporated.


Gradually add in the sifted dry ingredients, minding not to dump in too much at once lest you create a flour cloud. Next, add the carrots and blend for a few minutes longer.


At this point, if you are sure that no one you are cooking for is allergic to nuts, go ahead and mix in the pecans and/or walnuts. Otherwise, separate out a small amount of batter to make a nut\-free cake. The folks with really severe nut allergies still won’t be able to eat it, but at least this give those with less sensitive systems a shot at it.


Spread the batter out into deep sheets or baking dishes and bake at 350° F for about 30 minutes or until the cake is done. It should spring back lighty when pressed. Let the cakes cool completely before attempting to frost them.


### Making the Frosting


Do this in multiple batches, depending on the size of your food processor.


Combine butter, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a food processor. With the machine running gently stream in the maple syrup until you have a silk smooth frosting.
