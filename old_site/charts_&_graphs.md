If there's one thing we've learned, its's that YDW loves data. Where else would the chant \\"CHARTS and GRAPHS, CHARTS and GRAPHS\\" catch on like wildfire until all 160 people in the room are demanding to see the latest magic\-marker visualization?


We like to generate charts and graphs not only because it's fun, but because the organizing committee relies on your feedback to make data driven decisions about how we run the weekend. Check out these analyses to see how we're applying the information we collect.
