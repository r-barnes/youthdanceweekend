Held in September, YDW falls right in the middle of apple growing season in Vermont. What better way to take advantage of that than to serve warm apple crisp as our final dish of the weekend? This version comes primarily from [Pinewoods Camp](\"http://www.pinewoods.org\") with liberal modification by Sarah.

### Prep


Rinse and peel apples. Cut into eighths and then cut each eighth into thirds like so:


[![\"apple](\"http://69.195.124.91/~youthdan/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/AppleSlice1.png\" "\\"AppleSlice\\"")](\"http://69.195.124.91/~youthdan/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/AppleSlice1.png\")


 


Make sure to remove the hard bits of the core and the seeds.


Place apple slices in large bowl. Take 4 lemons and using a grater shave off the peel so that no yellow remains (i.e. zest them). Add the zest to the apples. Squeeze the juice from those same four lemons onto the apples.


In a food processor, combine the brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and pulse a few times to mix them together. Cut the butter into 1 inch chunks. Add a the butter to the food processor a couple of chunks at a time and process until mixture is crumbly (like coarse sand). You may need to do this in a couple of batches depending on the size of the food processor.


 


### Assembly and Baking


Preheat oven to 375° F. Grease baking pans.


Distribute apple mixture evenly among greased pans. Sprinkle 3 3/4 cups of plain white sugar over each pan. Spread out topping to cover each pan. Bake for approximately 30\-40 minutes until it is golden brown, bubbly, and fragrant. Cool for 30 minutes then serve.
