### Register Online


You MUSTfinalize your registration by **JULY 8TH** or your spot will be forfeited to the next person on the waitlist. Your registration is not final until you have received a confirmation email.


Since you've already paid $25 to enter the lottery, you are now sending in the remaining balance of your chosen total fee. The price list you'll see on the next page takes this into account with the registration categories adjusted accordingly. In other words, if you'd like to pay the \\"at cost\\" registration fee of $120, you should select the $95 option ($25 \+ $95 \= $120\). Want to pay the minimum? Select $65 ($25\+$65 \= $90\). Make sense? Good. If you have any questions, please [email us](\"mailto:register4ydw@gmail.com\").


Like the lottery sign up, we are using a virtual Shopping Cart system for registration. This means you can pay for your registration and t\-shirt at the same time! You can see the design of [this year's t\-shirt here](\"http://www.youthdanceweekend.org/ydw-2013/t-shirts/\"). You'll need to add a weekend registration (and a T\-shirt, if you want one) to your cart, then choose your registration fee price, and finally fill out the registration form.


Here's how it works:


*Be forewarned the registration form is a bit clunky. Sorry 'bout that, we're working to improve it for next year.*



 2. Click the **\\"Register for YDW 2013\\"** link below to add a registration to your cart.

 4. If you would like a t\-shirt also click the **\\"Add a t\-shirt\\"** link below.

 6. Click **“View Cart”** to move to the next step. You will be taken to the checkout page.

 8. Choose the price you would like to pay (remember the price list takes into account the $25 deposit you've already paid.)

 10. Then click **\\"Finish Registration\\"** to access the actual form.

 12. Fill out your info.

 14. Click  **\\"****Confirm and go to payment page\\"** to review your info and submit payment.

 16. You will be taken to PayPal to complete your payment. Your submission is NOT final until your payment is complete.

 18. You'll receive a confirmation email when your registration is final.

 20. If you have any questions, please [email the Registrar](\"mailto:register@youthdanceweekend.org\").
