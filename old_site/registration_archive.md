Registration is closed. YDW 2014 is underway!
---------------------------------------------


### Lottery Policy:


If we reach capacity on or before June 20th we will hold a lottery to determine who is coming to YDW.  This is our second year using a lottery system and it's still a work in progress. The basic idea is that rather than first come, first serve, we are holding a lottery for anyone who registered between 7:00 am on June 1st and 5:00 pm on June 20th with results returned no later than June 22nd. You could register either by yourself, as a party of one, or with another person, as a party of two. Anyone who gets in during the lottery will then finalize their registration, while everyone else is transferred to the waitlist. Anyone who registers after the lottery will be added to the waitlist in a first come, first serve manner. The lottery is weighted to give a bump to anyone who didn't get in during the previous year's lottery. We also aim for a minimum of 40% newcomers and will weight the lottery accordingly if necessary.


Specific tweaks we are making this year:



 * Registration will open on June 1st and close on June 20th (that's two days shorter than last year for those of you who are counting.)

 * We will hold the lottery (if necessary) on June 21st and return results immediately, thereby reducing the waiting period.

 * If you sign up during the registration period (June 1st\-20th), don't get in during the lottery, and end up not attending YDW even if offered a spot from the waitlist; then you will get preference during the next year's lottery. If this happens to you twice in a row, the 3rd year you will get in automatically.



We know some of you might still be unsatisfied with our registration system (sorry!) but we hope if that's the case you'll continue to let us know what you'd prefer. Not making any promises, of course, but we see YDW as an evolving experiment so we're gonna keep tinkering until we get it right!

### Cancelation Policy:


We’ve attempted to simplify our cancellation policy so that it is easier and faster to process refunds. We understand that cancellations are often the result of extenuating circumstances so please contact us if you feel you deserve an exception to the following guidelines.


If you cancel your registration on or before Sept. 1st we will offer you a full refund minus $10\.


If you cancel between Sept 1st and Sept 15th we will offer you a full refund minus $35\.


If you cancel on or after Sept 16th we will only offer you a refund on any portion of your fee that is greater than our “at cost” price of $130\. In other words, if you paid $90 to attend, we will keep your entire registration fee, but if you paid $300, we will only keep $130\. This is to account for the generosity of those individuals willing to pay more as sponsors.


Please note that your registration is not transferable; if you cancel we will assign your slot to the next person on the waitlist.
