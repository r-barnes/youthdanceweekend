Sarah (YDW Kitchen Manager) first encountered Beet Burgers when she was working in the [Pinewoods Camp](\"http://www.pinewoods.org\") kitchen. They are a delightful alternative to the standard tofu or tempeh vegetarian entree. Beet Burgers have proved to be a big hit with the YDW crowd and we hear more requests for this recipe than anything else we cook. The YDW Beet Burger recipe is based on the one used at Pinewoods with modifications from online sources.

### Prep


Grate beets, carrots, and onions (a food processor is very helpful here). Using a large colander, drain the veggies by pushing down on them until all the water is squeezed out. If you skip this step, the burgers will end up being too squishy. Put the drained veggies in large bowl. Mince garlic and add to veggies.



Boil enough water so that you have a 2:1 ratio for water:rice. Add dry brown rice to boiling water and reduce heat to low simmer. DO NOT STIR THE RICE!!! Check after 45 minutes to see if the rice is still sticky. If it is, cook for another 15 minutes. Once rice is no longer sticky remove from heat and allow to cool for 20 minutes. Cooking the rice can be done one day ahead of when you want to serve the burgers.


 


### Assembly and Baking


In a large bowl mix together veggies and rice. Add soy sauce, oil, sesame seeds, flour, sunflower seeds, salt, and pepper. Chop parsley and add to bowl. Toss ingredients until uniform.



Add eggs and cheese. Mix well until thoroughly combined. Using about a 3/4 cup of the mixture, form a patty between your hands. The patty should have about a 3 inch diameter and be about 1/2 inch thick. Set the patty on an oiled sheet tray. Continue making patties; line them up on the sheet tray in rows. Bake at 350° F until crispy \~20 minutes. You can freeze unbaked patties for up to 2 months.
