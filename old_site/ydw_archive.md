### **2013 ARCHIVE**


YDW 2013 took place at Kinhaven. 


Committee notes: “Music included a theremin solo on Turning by Threes and another epic Softly Good Tummas on Saturday night, using the percussion onstage. That last one may have now become a tradition. Saturday morning we partook in Le Grand Experiment, a social engineering ruleset experiment. For the first time since YDW 2\.0, we held an all\-camp community chat, The BIG Discussion, on the lawn. This conversation touched on a number of issues, including our individual roles in the dance community (now and in the future), tradition vs. innovation, recruitment, and “What to do with English?” After two years of filling up perhaps a little\-too\-quickly, we introduced a lottery after soliciting a bunch of feedback from the community. Pay\-what\-you\-can succeeded once more. Our secret emergent theme was Inclusivity, and we traded bead necklaces even though it was a little corny. 2013 also marked the last year for treasurer Julia Nickles, who in 2006 sent out the original survey feelers with Brian Gallagher.\\"


Performers:

### **2011 ARCHIVE**


YDW 2011 took place September 16\-18, 2011\. This was the first year YDW happened at Kinhaven Music School in Weston, VT. 


Committee notes: “In 2011, we had a few new things. Two new committee members, a revitalized mission statement, tabletop discussion topics (techno contra, gender\-free dancing, and ‘apple vs. orange: compare!’). Officially\-organized techno contras on Friday night. A more open late\-night schedule on Saturday. A new travel grant program to help folks come from further afield. We also had a new location, when damage to the area around Farm and Wilderness  (from Hurricane Irene) meant we needed to relocate to the Kinhaven Music School in nearby Weston, VT. There was lots of jamming and other fun, thanks in part to a phenomenal staff. 


Performers: 



* Andrew and Noah VanNordstrand playing for contras, English and couples dancing

### **2010 ARCHIVE**


YDW 2010 took place at Timberlake Camp at Farm and Wilderness. Committee notes: “In 2010, we were lucky to have simply gorgeous weather, along with fantastic music…. This year we held our first Community Master Class! People signed up to call or play for a dance, and then got feedback from staff musicians and callers. Dancers, led by Jesse “Hot Pants” Edgerton, worked on specific dance\-floor issues, such as dancing in a crowded hall, and switching gender\-roles, among many others. Ranger Stan was on vigilant dust patrol once again, and his efforts yielded a splendidly clean dance floor. We ate some of the best dance\-weekend food ever, and danced Money Musk for the third year in a row. It was excellent!”

It was slightly sunnier than the year before, but much colder \- temperatures were below freezing on both nights, but everyone kept warm by dancing. Ranger Stan Fowler was our official Dust Patrol, and our lungs were extremely thankful for his hard work. We built upon 2008’s Bread and Butter with a “Toast and Jam” activity where we asked participants to organize themselves into groups of people from the same geographical regions so that they could discuss issues specific to their home communities.


Performers:



* Magic Foot (Brendan Taaffe, Colin Linday, Christian Stevens, Stefan Amidon), playing for contra dances

* Ethan Hazzard\-Watkins, Anna Patton and Chloe Maher playing English

### **2008 ARCHIVE**


Committee notes: \\"The first YDW was held in 2008 at Timberlake Camp at beautiful Farm and Wilderness near Plymouth, Vermont. It rained for nearly the whole weekend! Still, we managed to have an excellent time dancing. The dance hall was extremely dusty! The committee then vowed to conquer dust in future years, using all methods available. The heart of the weekend was the ”Bread and Butter” session, held midday on Saturday, which provided participants the opportunity to voice their thoughts, concerns and solutions related to issues of youth involvement in traditional dance.\\"


Performers: 



* Elixir

* Nils Fredland, dance caller

* Sam Weiler, English caller
