**Lottery registration for YDW 2024 will open April 5th, 2024 and close May 31st, 2024\.** 





### Our lottery system:





Rather than first come, first served, YDW uses a lottery system for registration. You can register by yourself or with a group of up to four people. Everyone who doesn't make it in during the initial lottery is transferred to the waitlist. Anyone who registers after the lottery will be added to the waitlist in a first come, first served manner. We aim to provide opportunities for newcomers who have never been to YDW before to attend, and will weight the lottery accordingly if necessary.





As always, if you have questions and concerns please get in touch either via email register4ydw@gmail.com or [Facebook](\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/104532255579/\")





### Pricing Info





Part of YDW's mission is making a dance weekend that's financially accessible for young people. You don't have to pay to enter the lottery, but if you are admitted to the weekend there is a [Pay\-What\-You\-Can system](\"http://new.youthdanceweekend.org/general-info/register-details/\") for attendance. This means that as part of registration we'll be asking you to choose how much you'd like to pay to come to the weekend. Our at\-cost suggestion for payment is $185\. If you can pay that much, great! If you can't, our minimum required amount to attend is $115\. If you can pay above the asking price ($250, $350, $450, $550?) and want to pay at the \\"benefactor\\" level, that's even better! That will help us cover the costs for those who will be paying the minimum amount. 





### Cancellation Policy:





If you have already registered and paid for the weekend, and you need to cancel your registration for whatever reason, reach out to us. If you cancel before August 1, you will receive a full refund.





If you cancel during the months of August or September, you will receive a 50% refund.





Please note that your registration is not transferable. If you cancel, we will assign your slot to the next person on our waitlist. If you know you will not be able to attend, please cancel your registration early. This allows us to let people off the waitlist sooner and more people who need time to plan their travel will be able to attend!





We understand that cancellations are often the result of extenuating circumstances so please contact us if you feel you deserve an exception to the above guidelines. We are humans. We'll work with ya.
