YDW Registration, here's the skinny:
---------------------------------------------


Given the growing popularity of YDW and the rapidity with which we reached capacity in 2012, we modified the registration process in 2013 to address issues of fairness and accessibility.  We’re excited about the new system and hope you are too!


Our hope is that by switching to a lottery, we can reduce stress and anxiety by avoiding the rush to register as fast as possible. We realize that lotteries have their own drawbacks but we’ve included measures to alleviate the worst of them (e.g. allowing people to register as pairs). The new system is more complicated than our previous system and we anticipate there may be hiccups as we figure this all out together, but we’re confident that our community will handle it with the usual YDW finesse. As always, we are committed to open and lively dialogue about the weekend. We’ve tried to anticipate some of your questions \& comments below, and if you have any others, get in touch! You can contact us at [info@youthdanceweekend.org](\"mailto:info@youthdanceweekend.org\").
