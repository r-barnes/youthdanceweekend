**Jonathan Werk** is an oboist living and working in Montreal, after growing up as the child of a contradance musician in Ottawa. Music has always been a central focus in Jonathan's life; starting at a young age he developed a love for music of all genres from classical to irish to klezmer, which lead him to the unusual situation of playing oboe for traditional folk dances, including contradance, balfolk, and English country dance. Jonathan has performed for many dance events around Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Vermont, Massachussets, New York, and California, including dance camps including CDSS's English Week, Dance Music \& Spice, and BACDS's Hey Days. Jonathan volunteers extensively in his local Montreal dance community, as organizer, sound technician, and often caller. In addition to oboe, Jonathan also plays accordion, irish whistle, hotel bell, didgeridoo, and bombarde.


**Kristen Planeaux** began playing classical piano at the tender age of eight and continued on until she found her true calling—traditional dance musician—at 23\. Ever since, she has brought her own flavor of bold rhythm and warm, imaginative harmony to the English and American scenes. She is a retired member of *The Ripples* and a current member of *River Road* with Jesse Ball and Sarah\-Hadley Yakir.


**Grace Hendrickson\-Jones** is a Montreal\-based musician who plays with dance bands Modern Birds and Les Quatre Patates. They completed their Bachelor of Music in Classical Flute Performance at McGill University in 2019, and have been active in their local folk dance scene for the past ten years as a dancer, musician, caller and organizer.
