Formed on a rundown sidestreet in Portland, Maine, the men of RIPTIDE have spent the past few years roaming the United States searching for barbecue ribs and terrifying dance communities with profane chords and inexplicable screaming. Featuring dance favorite Glen Loper on the mandolin, Irish\-style fiddle player Alden Robinson, and Owen Marshall, Notary Public, on guitar, RIPTIDE plays vivid, imaginative music that has been thrilling dancers up and down the east coast and beyond.


The Sail Away Ladies

The Sail Away Ladies combine three of the most exciting, versatile, and accomplished young performers in the contemporary folk scene: Ari Friedman, Mia Friedman, and Eden MacAdam Somer.

Ari Friedman, a classically trained cellist from the Boston area, is one of few musicians to be challenging the boundaries of cello\-playing. She studied cello performance at Northwestern University, and also received a masters of music in Contemporary Improvisation from New England Conservatory. She tours internationally with Scottish National Fiddle champion Hanneke Cassel, plays with New England's highly acclaimed fiddle band, Childsplay, and has taught at fiddle camps from New England to New Zealand.


Mia Friedman started playing violin and singing at an early age. She has her roots in Americana and old\-time Appalachian traditions, and blends this with contemporary experimental music in her compositions. Now in her final year at New England Conservatory, she is an active composer and performer, and tours around the United States with Ari \& Mia, performs with Merryville Grammar School, and has her own solo act.

Eden MacAdam\-Somer's music transcends genre through soaring violin and fiddling, sweet vocals, and percussive dance. She has been a featured soloist with symphony and chamber orchestras, jazz and swing bands, and Eastern European and American folk ensembles. As a member of Notorious she has traveled across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, India, Iceland, the UK, and Afghanistan, delighting audiences with her unique style and flair. Eden has Bachelor's and Masters degrees in classical performance, and is currently working on her Doctorate at the New England Conservatory in the groundbreaking Contemporary Improvisation department.


At YDW this year the Sail Away Ladies will be joined by Max Newman and Owen Marshall on guitar.
