 * [The Country Dance and Song Society (CDSS)](\"http://www.cdss.org\") \- Find financial support, read the Starter Kits (compiled by Ethan and Max), and get lots of other assistance from this awesome organization.

 * [Boston Intergenerational Dance Advocates (BIDA)](\"http://bidadance.org/\") \- This cool group does cool things like mentorships at its dance series.

 * [Maple Morris](\"http://www.maplemorris.com/\") \- The morris dance event for younger dancers across the US and Canada.

 * [Shared Weight](\"http://www.sharedweight.net/\") \- List\-servs for callers, organizers, and musicians. Especially meant to be a place where newer folks can ask for advice.
