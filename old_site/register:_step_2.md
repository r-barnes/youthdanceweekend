### Register Online


We are using a virtual Shopping Cart system for registration this year so you can pay for the weekend and your T\-shirt all at once! You'll need to first add weekend registration and a T\-shirt (if you want one) to your cart, then choose your price, and then fill out the registration form. Here's how it works:



 2. Click \\"Add to cart\\" under the Lottery Signup listing to add registration to your cart.

 4. If you want a T\-shirt click \\"Add to cart\\" under the T\-shirt listing.

 6. When you're ready to start filling out some forms, click \\"View Cart...\\"
