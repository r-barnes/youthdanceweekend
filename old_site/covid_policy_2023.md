### We are working on our COVID policy for 2024, stay tuned!


### In the meantime, here's the COVID policy we used in 2023:


COVID rates are on the rise in New England and beyond, so it’s very important that we all work together take care of each other! In this vein, please take extra precautions to stay healthy in the week before YDW and while traveling to the weekend. If you are flying to YDW or taking some other form of public transit, please consider wearing a mask. And of course, if you have symptoms, please stay home!


#### **COVID policy:**


All campers must be vaccinated and show proof of vaccination before or upon arrival at camp. Each camper should bring two rapid tests (we will only have a few extras \- please reach out if this is a financial hardship) 



* First test: All participants must test upon arrival. You’re also welcome to test in the car on the way, as long as the test has been taken within 20 minutes of your arrival at Kinhaven. You will show the completed test to the designated checker at the check\-in table.

* Second Test: All campers will test before dinner on the second day of YDW (Saturday). You will be required to show your completed test to the designated COVID checker before heading into the dining hall to eat dinner.



Masks (N95, KN95, KF94, or equivalent) will be required indoors for all campers for the first 24 hours, except in the dining hall when actively eating. If all attendees test negative after the rapid\-testing on Saturday, masking will become optional for the rest of the weekend. If you start experiencing COVID symptoms before YDW, stay home and let the Committee know. If you start experiencing COVID symptoms at YDW, please immediately mask and distance and take a rapid test. If you test negative, please continue to mask for the remainder of the weekend. If you test positive, we will ask you and any close contacts (those who drove with you or slept in the same cabin as you) to leave, or we will provide a quarantine cabin for you.


We will provide:



* Extra rapid tests if you need one (our stock is limited so please bring your own if you can)

* A couple of pop\-up tents for eating outdoors (feel free to bring your own chairs or tents as well for eating outside!)

* Air purifiers for the dance hall and dining hall



For any questions about our COVID policy please reach out to us via email.
