### Congratulations!


The wait list has moved and we have a spot for you at Youth Dance Weekend! Please finalize your registration either online or by mail.


### Register Online


We are using a virtual Shopping Cart system for registration. This means you can pay for your registration and t\-shirt at the same time! You can see the design of [this year's t\-shirt here](\"http://www.youthdanceweekend.org/ydw-2013/t-shirts/\"). You'll need to add a weekend registration (and a T\-shirt, if you want one) to your cart, then choose your registration fee price, and finally fill out the registration form.


Here's how it works:


*Be forewarned the registration form is a bit clunky. Sorry 'bout that, we're working to improve it for next year.*



 2. Click the **“****Register for YDW 2013**”**** link below to add a registration to your cart.

 4. If you would like a t\-shirt also click the **“****Add a t\-shirt**”****link below.

 6. Click **“View Cart”** to move to the next step. You will be taken to the checkout page.

 10. Then click **“****Finish Registration**”**** to access the actual form.

 12. Fill out your info.

 14. Click  **“****Confirm and go to payment page**”**** to review your info and submit payment.
