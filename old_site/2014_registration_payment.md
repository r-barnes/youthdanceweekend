Remember, you're registration is not complete until we've received your payment and sent you a confirmation email. Please read on to finalize your spot at the weekend...


Pay\-What\-You\-Can: How the System Works
-----------------------------------------


You choose how much you can afford to pay to attend YDW, starting with a minimum of $90\. We trust you to consider carefully your means in relation to the cost of putting on the weekend and to be generous if you can.


### What YDW costs


The actual cost to put on the weekend is $130 per attendee. ($30 for food, $35 for the venue, and $65 to pay the staff and cover other miscellaneous costs \-\- everything from signs to web hosting to insurance.)


If you *can’t afford to pay $130*, that’s fine. We want the weekend to be available to everyone, you included. Pay what you can afford.


If you *can afford to pay $130*, please do.


If you *can afford to pay more than $130*, every dollar goes towards supporting other attendees and making YDW a viable, accessible, and awesome weekend. ($170 sponsors one other YDW attendee at the minimum cost. Paying $210 sponsors *two* YDW attendees at the minimum cost. Paying $250 sponsors *three*! Wow!)


*Please note:* If you can only afford $90, we hope you will come. That’s why we’re doing this after all. But... if everyone chose to pay the minimum of $90, the weekend would lose about $4500! (Yikes!) We’d strongly prefer for that not to happen. **So think about what you can pay and be generous.**


### Suggestions


Here are a few scenarios to help you choose a payment bracket:



 * **You are a student and your parents are helping cover the registration costs.**

	
 + Go for $130*.*
	



 * **You just graduated from college, are unemployed, and get a headache looking at your student loan balance.**

	
 + Maybe somewhere between $90 and $130 is for you.
	



 * **You have a steady job but remember what it was like to be in the above category.**

	
 + $150 will help make this a sustainable weekend.
	



 * **Life is good and you really dig the mission of YDW.**

	
 + Chip in $170, enough to cover someone who can only afford the minimum.
	



 * **You love the mission of YDW and want to give back.**

	
 + Cover two folks at the minimum level with $210\.
	



 * **If you are over 35, we suggest $170 or above*.***



These are just a few examples of the financial realities in our community. We hope that this new system will help you find an affordable, comfortable price regardless of your individual situation.
