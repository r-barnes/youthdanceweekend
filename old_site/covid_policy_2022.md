We want to have a fun weekend where everyone feels safe and limit our COVID risk as much as possible. Masks will be required at all times indoors but optional outdoors. We are requiring everyone to be vaccinated and boosted unless you have a medical exemption. We are requiring a negative PCR test within three days of the event and a negative rapid test within three hours of or upon your arrival to Kinhaven. We will be asking everyone to test again on Saturday as well. PLEASE BRING TWO RAPID TESTS with you or more if you have extra to share. If obtaining a PCR test or rapid test is a financial burden please let us know so we can help find a solution!  You will be asked to fill out two waivers before your arrival a Medical Attestation and a COVID Waiver.


We understand that obtaining a PCR test can be challenging and that if you've had covid in the last 90 days you might still test positive.


If you were ill with Covid between 14 and 90 days before YDW and you are worried about a positive PCR test, you can come to the weekend if:



* You are 14\-or\-more days past your original positive test.

* You can show a copy of your first positive test result to establish the date, if possible

* You have at least 2 negative rapid antigen or other CDC approved tests during the week before the weekend in addition to your day\-of\-arrival test.



PCR tests are the gold standard but we understand that they are not easily accessible to everyone. If you can not obtain a PCR test please take at least 2 negative rapid antigen or other CDC approved tests during the week before the weekend in addition to your day\-of\-arrival test.
