## Our COVID policy:

COVID/Illness Protocols and General Waiver for Youth Dance Weekend:

There will be two rapid testing required, one in advance of and one during the weekend. Our masking policy will be determined closer to the event date, and will be based on COVID-19 rates at that time. The state of respiratory illnesses is fluid, and policies may change per federal, state, or local authorities and guidance, as well as YDW weekend needs.

**MEDICAL ATTESTATION**

I certify that I will not attend the weekend if I knowingly have tested positive for a contagious or communicable disease, such as COVID-19. I understand that YDW is not responsible for any illnesses I may contract due to previous injuries, poor health conditions, or illness incidental to attending camp. To the best of my knowledge, I am in good physical condition and fully able to participate in this weekend.

Furthermore, by signing below I understand, affirm, and agree to the following:
I agree to comply with all YDW-required practices related to COVID-19.
I will follow any and all local, state and federal requirements or advisories, including CDC guidance, for preventing the spread of COVID-19. 
If I experience any symptoms of illness, I will refrain from participating in YDW activities and/or self-quarantine as instructed by the staff of YDW. If I have been around others that are ill I will mask for the duration of YDW. 
I understand failure to follow YDWâ€™s COVID-19 safety guidelines may result in my immediate termination from the weekend.
