## Our COVID policy:

COVID/Illness Protocols and General Waiver for Youth Dance Weekend:

There will be two rapid testing required, one in advance of and one during the weekend. Our masking policy will be determined closer to the event date, and will be based on COVID-19 rates at that time. The state of respiratory illnesses is fluid, and policies may change per federal, state, or local authorities and guidance, as well as YDW weekend needs.

**MEDICAL ATTESTATION**

I certify that I will not attend the weekend if I knowingly have tested positive for a contagious or communicable disease, such as COVID-19. I understand that YDW is not responsible for any illnesses I may contract due to previous injuries, poor health conditions, or illness incidental to attending camp. To the best of my knowledge, I am in good physical condition and fully able to participate in this weekend.

Furthermore, by signing below I understand, affirm, and agree to the following:
I agree to comply with all YDW-required practices related to COVID-19.
I will follow any and all local, state and federal requirements or advisories, including CDC guidance, for preventing the spread of COVID-19. 
If I experience any symptoms of illness, I will refrain from participating in YDW activities and/or self-quarantine as instructed by the staff of YDW. If I have been around others that are ill I will mask for the duration of YDW. 
I understand failure to follow YDW’s COVID-19 safety guidelines may result in my immediate termination from the weekend.

**WAIVER**

Youth dance weekend is insured and  strives to create a physically and emotionally safe environment for all attendees. Youth Dance Weekend is not responsible for incidences of illness or injury at the weekend. 
I, the undersigned, have read this list of agreements and protocols and fully understand its terms. I acknowledge that I am signing this waiver freely and voluntarily with full knowledge of its significance.		
[If signing electronically]: I understand that my typed or e-signature, below, is binding and shall be considered to be the same as my handwritten signature for the purposes of legal validity, enforceability, and admissibility.


## Anti-racism Statement

As the Youth Dance Weekend Committee, we acknowledge that racism and systemic bias exist. We acknowledge that many of the folk music and dance traditions we love have roots in Black traditions, and that the history of American folk music is complex and deeply entwined with racism against Black communities. We acknowledge that our Kinhaven venue sits on [Wabanaki (Dawnland Confederacy)](\"https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/wabanaki-confederacy/\") and [N’dakina (Abenaki / Abénaquis)](\"https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/abenaki-abenaquis/\") land.


We are committed to antiracist beliefs and practices, and we hold the expectation that our dance community will be committed to those beliefs and practices too. We strive to educate ourselves, learn from the past and honor that history in our approach to traditional music and dance. 


We want to provide an inclusive, safe and welcoming environment for everyone. White supremacy and white nationalism have no place at Youth Dance Weekend. Black lives matter. As a reminder, we have zero\-tolerance for harassment of any kind against any marginalized group. 


As a once\-per\-year event that brings together people from dance communities nationwide and even globally, we aim to celebrate our different backgrounds and perspectives. We encourage you to engage in discussions about these topics, to call out racism and call each other in for conversation, and learn from one other. We hope that all attendees will be inspired to bring this mindset back to their home dance communities.


We are still working to compile a list of educational resources, which you see below. If you have any you would like to contribute, please send them our way!
